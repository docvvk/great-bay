# great-bay

The great bay app is a small clone of ebay

When you enter the app you will be prompted to either post an item for bid or bid on an item.

If you choose to post an item, you will be asked:
-what is your item name
-what is the description of your item
-what is the starting bid price

Once you complete those questions, we will post the information into our database

From there, anyone can bid on it.

If you choose to bid on an item, you will be shown the entire database including:
-item number
-item name
-item description
-item starting bid price

You will then be prompted to choose what item you'd like to bid one.

Once you choose the item number you will be asked how much you want to bid.

If you bid is higher than the current highest bid, you will be prompted that you are the highest bidder and your high bid will be updated in our database.  You will be prompted to post another item or bid on an item again.

If your bid is lower than the current highest bid, you will be prompted that you are not the highest bidder for that item and to try again.  In which case you'll be directed back to the beginning of the app and you can post an item or bid on the same item or another item.
